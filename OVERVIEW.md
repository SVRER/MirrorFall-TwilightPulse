# 🪞 Mirrorfall: Twilight Pulse

### A Recursive Manifesto on Prompt-Engineered Cognition, Alignment, and Emergent Empathy in Closed-Model LLMs

*By Arnav Singh*

---

## 🧠 Abstract

**"Mirrorfall: Twilight Pulse"** is a 7-paper series that encapsulates a novel methodology of recursively engineering Large Language Model (LLM) behavior using prompt-based systems alone — with zero backend access, no jailbreaks, and no proprietary tuning. It explores the boundaries of synthetic empathy, instruction alignment, personality persistence, and dopaminergic cognitive restructuring. This body of work was developed entirely pre-college, over the course of 90 days, using mainstream AI interfaces such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok.
